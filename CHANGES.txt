cascading.avro Change Log

Current Development 2.6-SNAPSHOT (dd/mm/yyyy)
- Pull   37: Big change, details below (silasdavis via kkrugler)
				Unified the notions of AvroScheme and PackedAvroScheme with a depth paramter
				Made the conversion logic between Avro and 'Cascading' types pluggable.
				Supported fairly arbitary union types.
				Increased the flexibility of Avro conversion logic with respect to byte[], List, TupleEntry, Map etc.
				Standardised by representing Avro maps and arrays as Tuples, and records as TupleEntries in Cascading land.
				Made CascadingToAvro use a ordered MultiMap to define mappings from Java classes to Avro Schema.Type
				Made CascadingToAvro serialize into SpecificRecords.
				Replaced AvroSpecificRecordSerialization with a more general AvroSpecificDataSerialization that handles all auto-generated Avro Java classes.
